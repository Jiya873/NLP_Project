I made my fiancé download just so we can talk about the stories. I don't even really mind the ticket thing. However, I really mind the diamonds thing. I HATE that to wear certain thing and for certain choices I have to spend my diamonds or my real money to get diamonds. I mean this would cost me a fortune with all the stories I read. Personally, I think locking certain whole stories would be a better option. I much rather spend my money buying the most popular books then spend it on the choices I want to do because you run into a million and that will cost a fortune. It also would set this story app apart from the others because I've never see any of them do that. I even talked to my mother in law who had this app and she told me she deleted it because she couldn't choose what she wanted to choose. It's the apps biggest down fall. If it was changed, I would say it's perfect and reccomend it to everyone. I mean heck even the tickets to read a chapter can make you money. There's no reason for diamonds on choices. You can also through in adds for all I care. As long as I get to choose the choice I want. Hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears. I love the app tho!

I love this app but I do have some frustrations that I have noticed many others also have. In order to play, you have to have a ticket per chapter and you only get 3 tickets daily so that really limits what you can read without spending a ton of money on more. I'm also slightly frustrated with the diamonds in the same sense. You earn two per chapter read with the option to watch a video and earn four (if that option is working that day) but each choice costs between 12 and 17 or even more diamonds and each story has many choices that you are forced to not choose the answer you actually want to give, without spending a lot of money. Now I don't mind making purchases with real money once in a while for a game that I really enjoy like this one but I do have a problem when a game is so obviously a giant money grab. I believe there are ways to still make money from this game without having each choice be so costly because that makes the gameplay so much less enjoyable for the person who wants to choose a response and cannot. And the same with tickets. The choices should cost wayyyy less than the amount they take, they could still earn the money there but obviously not as much but they would have more people keep playing for much longer instead of getting so mad that they stop playing and buying altogether. There has to be a happy medium and there has to be less greed. I mean, it's not like they are actually paying these authors",5,False,user309641290,5 stars,"{'id': 40921043, 'body': 'Pity if the game did not live up to your expectations.

I get to pick her name so all of them are me lol... the best way to read a book is to put yourself into the main roll, so I do. It is so much fun, then you get to choose what happens, well for the most part. There are tickets for reading the chapters you usually get 2 and it takes an hour for one to be replenished, 
(you can buy more if you want/need) but to start a new book is free. outfits and some choices cost diamonds (which I wish were less so I could choose more options) they usually cost 12 for a nice out fit/ tempting choice or 17 diamonds for the best outfit/spicy choice so it adds up quickly, however there are choices/outfits that don’t cost, however they usually are not something I would normally choose. But I will sacrifice an outfit for a choice later. I also love the stories. Besides that the other thing I would change is a chance for a back button, I don’t know how many times I have lost control of my phone and as I’m trying to grab it again I have hit the screen and changed the story, or I put it down for a moment and my cat stepped on it and changed it. 
Also I get often that the system will not let me in please try again later, which is super annoying but it usually corrects itself in a few hours. I would recommend this to everyone that likes to read and make their own choices, however it is super addictive. 😁",5,False,lil' debbie g,Love this app.,

The amount of passion put into most of the stories are addicting and enjoyable! However, there are often times the storylines and plots get repetitive and/or boring, including common tropes like “billionaire workaholic” or “arranged marriage” because the MC is poor. There have been many times where I take a break from the app for weeks before popping in again to check out if any of the new ones are any good. Don't even get me started on the price and amount of work you have to do for the diamonds. The absolutely ridiculous newest update has the “earn diamonds” section to be now only providing 1 diamond for the web ads instead of its usual amount of 2 diamonds… The ads and websites we have to click to watch and read to earn diamonds are already enough work, the insane update is just the cherry on top! There should definitely be more diamond earnings, or at least have the diamond earnings be kept at 2 instead of 1. I also really miss when back then, we used to get 2x diamonds every few days weekly but now it only happens during a holiday :( Those were the times when I enjoyed Chapters the most.

I took one survey 6 times in 24 hours on two different devices and default browsers just receive nothing.

The ones for samples don’t give rewards they just make you click 47 different yes nos or more options over and over after you registered and once again nothing. I do love this game mainly because of one series this far but even my paying for VIP feels like I’ve only gained 30 diamonds per day from it which is nothing compared to Chapters. I actually received 126 diamonds for completing the same “offer” in Chapters.  Choices only rewarded 11 in which I never received thus forcing me to see the books from Choices.

It’s just that an ad pops up like every two seconds I try to read a story. Even if you press the ticket button you still get like 2–3 ads before it actually starts, it’s crazy and very repetitive. Does it almost all the time. I try pressing bc the next chapter to a story? When I first downloaded this game it was just an ad or 2 depending on which button I pressed (ticket or watch an ad) cus if I pressed ticket it wouldn’t give me an ad and if I pressed ad it’d give me one and the story went on. But now it’s basically the exact same thing, no matter what, it’s just that if you press ad you have to watch 4 instead of 3 ads. 

Also, I’ve never had a big problem with the diamonds because i almost always play the user stories since they’re ‘better’? In some way or another.

2020-08-24 05:00:42,"Honestly, I feel like Chapters has the potential to be a really good app, due to the amount of diverse stories there are. However, it’s still lacking in a few things. 

1. Stories are mediocre at best, but occasionally you’ll find a gem here and there. These stories pander to mostly lonely middle-aged women and fit a very stereotypical scenario most of the time. Chapters has multiple stories that cover a lot of the same tropes over and over...The hot daddy millionaire, boy next door, or your typical vampire love story, the one where the guy is a big tsundere in denial of his love for you and has an extremely toxic personality...Chapters has a little bit of everything for everyone. But the tropes are heavily recycled over and over. This app has so many stories, but lacks diversity when it comes to tropes.

2. Diamonds. I know recently Chapters has tried to make it fair for users who don’t pay, but come on...Paying 17 diamonds for choices that basically don’t matter with barely any outcome? That’s a little ridiculous. Especially, when we get very few diamonds after the stories themselves. I wouldn’t have an issue with waiting to collect diamonds, watching ads for them, etc...but choosing diamond choices with little or no outcome is a bit silly. Why not put the diamond choices on the choices that will have a real impact on the story?

2020-04-14 13:11:24,"I consider this app to be one of the best interactive games for 2 reasons. The first, it really does have some of the best stories compared to other apps that are similar. The second, it is one of the best money grabs I’ve ever witnessed!!! All of the important choices require you to use diamonds and it seems like every 3rd or 4th choice is an important choice. The choices cost at least 12 or 17 diamonds, some others as much as 20 or 30. There’s usually 3 choices, only one of them won’t require diamonds. Diamonds are hard to come by unless you are willing to buy them, the 30 diamonds for $1.99, get you 2 choices lol. Most stories are anywhere from 14 to 20 chapters and each chapter easily has about 8-10 choices that require diamonds. You can sacrifice outfit choices that require diamonds to save some, it just means you may end up on a date to a benefit gala dressed in a button-up shirt and ankle length pleated skirt!! The choice options are so skillfully crafted too, the free choice is almost always something with a negative outcome. Not all the stories require diamonds for outfits, I’ve come across one with all free outfit choices.

Considering that I just joined the game yesterday, I’m already done with my diamonds  which means I’m enjoying the game and I’m currently wanting to get more, but I feel like the cost for the responses are way too high. Also, the fact that we only get a certain amount of diamonds and a certain about of tickets until we need to watch ads, complete surveys, and other requests to get more diamonds and those requests don’t build up as much diamonds as we need to normal play the game without having to wait a lot of time to play again.

The biggest thing is the writing and stories themselves. They’re abysmal on Chapters, just an enormous pile of trashy smut crap. I have to stop by the second or third chapter because I feel like I’m losing brain cells. I love Poison Study but that’s by M. Snyder, not you guys. And I dare you to write a story as incredible as Blades of Light and Shadow on Choices. Good luck with that. There’s also no wardrobe feature to change outfits whenever you want like these other apps do. And of course the diamond crap is ridiculous. I might be inclined to buy/use them if they added to and enhanced the plot in any way, but they do absolutely nothing. On Choices, diamond choices add so much, and btw you can also watch 100 ads for diamonds, all at once. I’m a happy VIP member there. On Romance Club choices also matter, and they also do diamond rush events where all choices are free, so I always purchase teacups (I.e. passes) so I can read more.

I’ve only read two stories so far. One story I finished, the other I’m on the last few chapters. I can honestly say that I do like the actual stories so far. Both stories that I’ve read have been LGBTQ+ stories, which are the only two LGBT stories I can find. It bothers me that there is barely any diversity on this app. You can’t even really customize the characters to how you’d like them to look. Another thing that bothers me is the diamonds system. Now, I’ve seen this complaint a lot in the reviews. That should say something to the app developers. It’s highly inconvenient that I have to either pay hard earned money for diamonds, or just choose the option without diamonds. How am I supposed to make a choice that costs me 12-20 diamonds when I only have 7, and only get one per finished chapter? Someone in the conference room needs to reevaluate their math skills... Also, the problem with that is, the story will not go the way that I wanted it to. Which makes me disinterested with the book and wanting to just stop reading it and deleting the app altogether.

The one thing I would take note of...definitely give more options for character. I feel like most people want to make a character as similar to them as possible. Unfortunately, in some of the stories, the girls are hideous lol. Women of color should also have more choices as well. What...they get one girl? And Asians get one girl?

While the content of this app (the actual books) is great - from the clothing options to your choice on how the story goes - the cost is so ridiculously high and cost prohibitive.

For those of us who don’t have the funds to pay the unbelievably egregious amount the creators ask for and are at a high risk of identity theft, this leaves very little options. Given this, and even after reaching out to the creators multiple times with options for those of us who cannot afford the money or the risk to our identities, I was rudely rebuffed. I would gladly praise this app if they would create a monthly subscription at a flat rate and not charge the 17 or 12 gems per choice but rather 3 or 4 if necessary. I am by NO means asking them to do anything for free. Rather, I am simply asking for a consideration to be made for those who love to read but may be at a disadvantage for lack of funds or fear of identity theft.

I’ve downloaded pretty much all the different (at least popular) games that are similar to this one, and I will say this one has the most polished feel and best range of stories, in my opinion.

That being said, I understand it’s important as game developers that you are supported for the product that you have put out, so I understand requiring gems for certain outfits and progressive choices within the game. However, I’ve played similar games where gems are used to unlock extra parts of the story, instead of demeaning you or ruining relationships because you don’t use them. It’s encouragement to use gems, to gain access to extra scenes and to support you as developers in the process, versus a feeling of getting punished for not doing so. The first leaves a positive connotation on the player (even when they don’t have enough gems to unlock the choice), while the latter that is currently being used feels more like force or punishment.

The thing that irritates me the most is that every time it’s an option involving diamonds, I ALWAYS want to pick that option. It’s so frustrating. Just like other reviewers have said, I honestly don’t mind the ticket to play system, and you could definitely make a killing off of just that, or do what other apps do, throw in ads every once in a while.

I think it’s dumb because if there going to give you less then they should lower the prices for the choices.

Now the only way to get more diamonds is to become a VIP and I’m not paying to become a VIP when this is only a game. I think they should change it back to getting to diamond after a chapter then an extra too if you watch the ads. Also the conversion for the the diamond exchange is honestly outlandish 40 for ONE diamond. It should be like 5 for 1 since you don’t have that many opportunities to get them anyway!

Playing Hard to Master is my favorite, but one chapter was something I would have used my safe word on and I didn’t have the option to in the book. I was really grossed out by my character dressing up as a school girl for the boyfriend. It’s something I’m really against because of how perverted it is, and I didn’t have an option to say no. I would have spent diamonds to say no to that. In the book Seven Day Fiancé, all the good options cost diamonds. Otherwise I have to allow the family to emotionally abuse my friend? That’s not okay. I would have walked out and never spoken to them again irl. I wish there were better options without costing so much, and I wish that if I have to chose a non payable one that I wouldn’t be penalized for it. I also want the option to say no to sexual scenarios I would never go along with.

My review for Seven Day Fiancé:
I hate this story. There are usually 2 options. The good one that protects your relationship from the family and towns emotional abuse costs diamonds. The one that hurts and throws your friend under the bus and ends in a bad situation with all eyes on you is free. I played this book for the diamonds at the end of the chapters.

The way the app is run, however, is why I am leaving a 1 star review.  The stories I’ve read have been really entertaining, but I really don’t think 1 and a half stories should have cost me $90.  And I didn’t even use all of the premium options.  The “free” version of the stories is threadbare and make the characters seem pathetic and uninteresting.  The only way to inject humor and spice into the stories is to use diamonds.  I’m talking lots and lots of diamonds; hundreds of diamonds.  And the other ways to earn diamonds, other than buying them, are ridiculous.  Most choices require 17-40 diamonds.  The app lets you earn diamonds 1 at a time, and there are very low limits on how many you can earn in a day.  I felt like I was paying a ransom to free the actual story.  It strikes me as being incredibly greedy.

My other problem is in the lack of oversight.  There is a story in the “taptales” section that is a straight cut and paste of an older story on a different website.  Comments have been left for the past 4 months about the issue, but there is no sign it has been looked into.  Basic oversight and accountability should not rest solely on the players’ shoulders.

I was liking Bad Boy Blues, except for the fact that it kept skipping over intimate parts, but then saying later that they happened. It was weird and made the story very disjointed. A lot of the choices are ridiculous. I can either answer a simple question with a simple answer paying diamonds, or I can go over the top and lash out for no reason whatsoever for free and be highly over dramatic. I like that tickets come every 30 minutes, instead of 2 hours. I don’t like that each “premium choice” costs 12-24 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for finishing a chapter. Also, in the past few days, I have only been getting 1 diamond for about every FIVE chapters, which is really annoying.

The only time when the choices actually matter are for the ending. While you only get 1 diamond every chapter you read, there is the possibility to spend about 100 diamonds in one chapter. This causes the reader to be frustrated and makes it not as fun. While there are some great stories on here, it isn’t worth it to spend your own money on this game. Also, the customization for characters is severely lacking. It’s annoying how every story offers different options for what you want your character to look like. It would be better if there was a more custom option that could be used for all the stories. There are on average 4 different options for what to look like for each story, and some offer zero customization at all.

Because unless you’re choosing the diamond options, your story will turn out less than desirable and makes the stories no longer worth reading and way less enjoyable. The books become more about getting diamonds than the actual content. This completely takes away from the creative aspect that comes from reading such amazing and diverse stories. At the very least redemption codes could last longer than 24hrs or when you complete an offer you should actually get the diamonds you worked for.

The re-live option would be free (can use diamonds to unlock but don’t make it a crazy amount… 50 sounds good).

The only “decisions” you get to make for your character for free are things like “do you say ‘hi,’ ‘hello,’ or ‘what’s up?’” Most decent decisions cost 17 diamonds. You can earn 5/day from watching 5 ads, and you earn one at the end of a chapter. But there are SEVERAL decisions to make per chapter. So to make the decision they know the reader wants, it will take you 3+ days of watching ads. It would take you weeks to finish one chapter that way, so I was a sucker and bought diamonds. I’m so annoyed at myself, but I’m a Jennifer Armentrout fan and was excited Obsidian was on here. Some examples of choices are—your friend looks upset. Ignore her or tell her to get over it, or for 17diamonds ask her what’s wrong.  I went through most of the story having my character act like a complete witch with no redeeming qualities because those were the only free choices. And where’s the fun in that. 
The idea is neat, but the execution is horrible. If anything buy stock in this app because these people have to be making a ton of money. It would seem less of a rip-off if you could choose to watch more ads to earn diamonds or something.

A more reasonable price would be $5-10 for one whole story (which is more or less the same amount you would spend on the novel they are often based on). If the developers weren’t gouging readers for money, I think they would end up making more money as consumers are more likely to spend if they are getting a better value for their money. You can earn virtual goods (“diamonds”) by watching ads, but the diamond spending choices crop up so often that it is difficult for the readers to immerse themselves. By the time you earn or spend enough, you’re no longer sucked into the story and less inclined to continue your patronage. I’ve cut myself off at spending $40, which is relatively the amount I would spend on an entire PC or console game, and certainly way too much to spend on just one app- especially considering the meager amount of content $40 will unlock.

That being the first story I played having main character knocked out and taken to a remote cabin where the love interest continuously pushed for physical intimacy. The gems you are given to pay for more options only pay for uncomfortable options and a lot of times it seems you cannot avoid the uncomfortable or weird options. This game is very strange and to know I was getting ads for it playing puzzle games and knowing that kids are downloading games like this makes me sick. There aren’t enough restrictions for games like these. I would be really upset to know young children were reading stories that perpetuated the sexualization of school girls or being knocked unconscious and kidnapped. Being kidnapped and/or sexualized in school is not something to be excited about. It even involves a steady theme of your “love interest” waiting until you’re “old enough” to pursue you.

You can watch adds to earn gems but you don’t get very many and the ads are about 45 seconds. A lot of the stories are similar. There’s a rich person, someone who falls in love with them, and a crazy person. The most diverse are the paranormal ones. Hardly anything that’s relatable. A lot of the time you either have to choose a choice you don’t want or spend money for gems for the other choice. And some of those choices are even more than the rest of the story. I was somewhat content with having some stories end the way they did but others just made me angry because I felt like I really didn’t get a choice. There are also grammatical errors in every story I have read. Hire a proof reader or something. Some of the story ideas are good ones but the best this going for this app is the graphics.

As a college student I love getting away from life for a bit to read these stories. It’s taken me a long time to get to a balance between my wallet, and my impulse to get more diamonds to make it through the stories. In order to effectively do so I maintain a premium membership so I can have more diamonds for choices that require them during breaks and times I’m able to read more without procrastinating on other things.

The second thing I would suggest is to add a system where there is a wheel that is offered at least once every day so people can win things that will give them things such as free diamonds, free tickets, a free story for the day, and even maybe a VIP Membership for a week if they get lucky enough.

Either get rid of the wait time or get rid of the limit on how many ads you can watch a day. Also having 3 back to back 17 gem options in 2 minutes of part of a story is bordering greedy.

However I love the idea of adding special gem reward choices for certain moments if chosen correctly. When comparing the discrepancy between a unique choice (gems) and number of gems potentially you could get from reading a chapter.

Don’t get it. The stories usually hold my attention. However, the tickets and diamonds cost to MUCH. There should be a maximum number of diamonds and tickets the writer can incorporate into their stories. There should also be checks on advertising since they count towards a maximum the reader can use to earn daily. They need to be specific about the number of diamonds that can be earned… daily.

1. You need gems for every decision that doesn’t include rejecting your love interest and this was a huge turn off to me. Especially since you get so few and have to spend so many at a time. I found that caused me to lose a bit of interest. I think if it cost less gems to do things or you earned more easily it would keep game players interest. 

2. The idea of the tickets to go to the next chapter is nice. I just think you should be able to earn them the same way you earn gems. This will also keep players interested and playing more (in my opinion). 

3. The treasure chest of gems is a good idea, but I feel it occurs too often. I just started and it seems majority of the gem I have earned have been put into treasure chest for me to purchase. That caused me to put the game down for awhile even though I had a day pass. Honestly having the day pass is what made me come back to it. Maybe if the chest wasn’t so constant and people got a chance to actually collect gems more often from things other than just adds it will keep them more intrigued.

1) ads
You don’t have to watch them if you don’t want to BUT then you lose out on free diamonds and doubled rewards and other rewards. I’m forcing myself to watch every ad possible to get as many rewards because somehow I find myself low in them. 

2) I have actually bought diamonds, tickets, vip, and diamond pass. It’s SO WORTH IT. I save so much in rewards while I’m in the app and the regeneration time is cut down and the max amount to stock up on for tickets is increased. 

3) I haven’t really played any phone games or used any other entertainment app since I got Chapters. It’s that interesting. 

4) there’s 2 sections of this app. There’s one where you can choose choices as you move through the books and then there’s the community section. The community section has me dying. But also you don’t use any diamonds in the community section; you can use tickets to read or watch an ad. There’s no limit to how many ads you can watch to activate a chapter in the community section.

There should be a few stories  that you can play in a male’s perspective rather than a female’s. I also think that the game is to expensive and that the rewards offered are not enough. 

In the game, you are given the option of exchanging coins for diamonds. 40 coins is equal to one diamond, which I think is a rip-off. The system can be change by having ten coins equal one diamond, which I think is more fair.  You are also allowed to complete objectives to obtain coins. But, most of those objectives include buying premium outfits or options. These require diamonds, which I usually lack. 

There should also be other ways to obtain free diamonds like watching ads for two diamonds each. I also believe that the cost of selecting certain options during gameplay is too strenuous and expensive. I have to earn a lot of coins and watch a lot of ads just to get up to twelve diamonds to open up one option, I have done it so much that it gets tiresome and I end up not wanting to play.

So as I said before, premium choices cost more diamonds than in other apps. However, the app is not consistent in how you can earn diamonds. You can always buy, but I try to not too that too often. At one point you got a chance to earn 5 diamonds a day. Then, recently, it changed to you could earn as many diamonds as you were willing to sit through ads. I personally like the last option because I can just run the ads on my phone through the work day so I can have enough to get through a couple of chapters when I’m home.

2018-04-13 20:40:47,"I enjoy reading some of the stories. Yes, the writing needs some work and some of the stories are extremely cliche, but they can be fun to read.

One issue is that it gets really annoying with the gems, as to do any action it costs a lot. In the earlier stories made, if you chose a certain option you could gain gems yet that stopped for some reason. And to get free gems, you can watch one video and get one, complete a chapter of a book you haven't read (so you only get a gem if it's the first time you read it), once you finish a book you'll get some, and there's the tasks needed to be completed as well (only on first completion of book) 

Although it seems like there's a lot of ways to earn gems, it's actually difficult to do so, since the prices for outfits and actions in the book are expensive. I think if there were more ways to earn gems (with the new added feature, with earning cards for certain tasks completed in a book), you could make it so when you get a card you earn gems or making it so in the new stories, if you choose a certain option you're able to get gems too.

For one, you wait hours upon hours to only receive 2 tickets, and half the time the episodes only last maybe 5 or 6 minutes even when they claim to last 12. Also, I already know tons of people have made comments about diamonds or gems. I understand there are multiple ways to earn them, but it takes forever to accumulate enough and actually be able to use them and even then you have to kind of save them until the end to get the result you want which makes zero sense. If you make half of the story diamond options, give us more diamonds at a time or more ways to earn them. I’ve dealt with the app closing out on me as well when I go to collect my diamonds at the end of the episode and I never receive them. This makes it that much more frustrating.

As an avid player of Choices and a writer, this game is boring and terribly written. I feel as if I’m reading a fan fiction written by someone who’s never left their house. 
For example, I read a story titled Calendar Girl (or something like that) and in the first two chapters all the MC did was talk about sex. The drama was unrealistic, and I get that it has to be slightly exaggerated to make it interesting, but it moves too fast. In the second chapter I had already ditched my family, and was living with a random guy. And the guy was supposed to be hot and sexy, but he just came off like a total creep. 
And yeah, you only have to wait half an hour for a ticket, but what’s the point of getting tickets fast when what you’re using them for isn’t worth it? And the diamond choices are awful - you barely skim the surface if you don’t want to pay.

Firstly, customization options are too limited and not consistently attractive or up to date with modern fashion. Some hairstyles do not match up with the faces of the Characters, and can turn people off from reading the rest of the book. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve stopped reading a book because MC looked too constipated for my liking and her love interest was just as bad. I highly recommend a character closet (where you can change the appearance of your character whenever you want—hair, clothes, makeup, eye color, etc.) or a broader (and more consistent) range of options to choose from.

Secondly, there are responses that should not cost gems in certain stories. Sometimes it does matter if you “walk away” or “take a step closer.” But there are some times where spending 15 gems just goes to waste because no matter what you say, the outcome is the same.

The only difference, quite frankly, was that the graphics of the Chapters ad were much worse. I'm almost positive that the Episode advertisement was made before the Chapters one, since I've seen it several times in the past few months, but I just now, for the first time, saw the Chapters ad. I'm sure that other companies wouldn't appreciate direct plagiarism of their work, even if it was just an ad. I can also imagine that your readers aren't thrilled, either. Dirty marketing is never a good idea, and if it does somehow end up getting you ratings or money, in the end, it'll ultimately make your company look bad.

Not only has this came up, but the graphics of this game aren’t exactly the greatest, everything is extremely overpriced, and several stories are kind-of uncomfortable due to some creepy characters that seem like they’ve assaulted someone within the last 24 hours.

Maybe I’ll give this app a chance again, but things will definitely need to change.

Some obviously written better than others. I read someone’s else review that suggested charging per book instead of charging for clothes and choices. This would have me reading more. I don’t mind spending some money on tickets if I’m very involved in the story. This would be a much better idea and much more fair to the people who are reading.

With Chapters, I really like that you get rewards for being a loyal reader, it’s 30 minutes wait time for a ticket to read a chapter, and sometimes by making certain choices you get bonus diamonds. The problem in my opinion with Chapters is the storyline for most of their books. They all have the same kind of story line with someone having either a history of an abusive relationship or mean parents. And the love part of the novel doesn’t include any chase and often the characters seem so creepy. Most of what they say are not realistic AT ALL. In the story His, in the first chapter, one character is already talking about making some stranger he met “climax”. Wait, what? I’ve also seen a lot of typos.

Usually, up until the last couple of weeks, the “earn diamonds” section had so many options to just click on the ads, rather then purchasing something from their sponsors to earn diamonds. But lately earning 2 is sparse and more complicated to actually receive the diamonds. 
I really liked how when you finished a chapter you were offered to watch a video to earn 4 diamonds total rather than 2. Now you have to watch a video in order to receive 2! 
Instead of being able to pay your ticket to read a chapter, you also have to play an ad from their sponsors.

That aside, the diamonds cost WAY TOO MUCH for a choice. Which makes jumping through hoops to save money to earn diamonds not worth even playing!

Just like other games Chapters has its pros and cons  For example the stories are amazing and very fun to play. But they you have to watch ads and buy gems to get extra content in stories. If you think about it you’ll be like “oh 5 ads for 5 diamonds that’s not hard” but then you realize that after every ad you watch you have to wait 2 minutes. Also it has kicked me out when I’m writing a story. Another thing that happens often to me and lots of players is that it doesn’t even let us get on the app. You’ll click on it and it’ll say “CHAPTERS” “Choose your Romance” then on the bottom it’ll say “no resource update”.

You earn gems making the right choices during the chapters and one gem when you finish a chapter. Also, the gem choices have only gone as high as 17 which is really good compared to other apps... Along with NO ADS!!!

The only suggestion that I have is, why not give an option for a subscription? Where you can pay month by month or even by the year to have unlimited tickets (not gems). Sometimes I get so engrossed with a story, that I often find myself having to wait 30 minutes for 2 tickets (some stories being 26 chapters long) and it takes forever to read a story.

I do spend money sometimes buying gems and tickets, but I don't always have the extra money to spend a of the time. Maybe if there were a subscription option, everyone who played the game could have the one time purchase option and wouldn't have to wait so long to finish a story.

2.) Lots of spelling mistakes for a game that is mostly about reading. I can understand one or two, but I’ve definitely counted more than two. That, and quite a few punctuation errors as well. More than a game about reading should have.
3.) Weird emotions. The characters seemingly get angry over...nothing. Or sad. Or resentful. It’s very strange.
4.) Diamond ads. I can’t play the ads. I don’t know if that’s just on my phone or on everyone’s, but I’m unable to gain diamonds by watching ads and it seems a little odd that the offer is there and I can’t use it.

The downside is even if you purchase diamonds somehow they get lost in each chapter that you start it’s rather annoying when you pay for something and it’s not there for you to use without explanation.

You can’t ever choose the option you want because yoi never have enough gems. And when you read through chapters and books, you barely get any gems for doing so. Also choosing an outfit should not be the same amount of gems as say, having wild sex with the man who’s been teasing you for 4 chapters!! It’s not enjoyable when you receive two options, such as, let him kiss you passionately for 17 gems, or storm out for free, when the situation and conversation you’re having in the book would never let it make sense that you storm out. It’s obnoxious. And it makes me want to delete the app and just go back to reading my kindle where at least I know the best choice is always taken.

2019-11-18 14:53:14,"Agree with many of the other comments.  I understand the point of making tickers and diamonds harder to get and in longer time span is to make money off of purchases but if you opted to purchase them, you would have to spend a ridiculous amount of money on just one story to even read it in a reasonable amount of time and with making even just some of your chosen choices.  Forget outfits...I have never opted to use diamonds on those because I just never have enough for other things...
And again, I get the ploy but if you want to read a story and don’t have enough diamonds to select the optimal choice...why does the free one have to be something that just ruins the rest of the story..

Every time I finished playing I was usually in a terrible mood because of the short chapters, terrible choices, awkward writing, and ridiculous gem costs. 

I started playing Chapters for the steamy scenes, since most apps don't include the details. But to get the good stuff in Chapters, you have to slog through a lot of terrible content. I imagine the original stories are just fine but in being adapted to Chapters' format they become shallow. Plus you usually need to shell out a LOT of gems to get good scenes, and if you aren't trying to spend money that means endless mining on bad stories. 

But I finally reached my breaking point when I played FOUR stories in a row that involved graphic depictions of domestic violence/sexual assault and yet there were ZERO content warnings. I love stories about survivors healing and learning to love again but you can do that either without graphic triggering content OR providing appropriate warnings.

There are a few downsides though. The first is choosing your character. There are only 4 options on how that character looks. I wish there was a way to choose face shape, hair length as well as color, nose shape, etc. All the other games I’ve played allow that. 

The second thing is that most of the stories have the same storyline: girl gets cheated on/abused and falls for someone else. Not that original to be honest. And why does every girl end up in bed with the guy? It’s so explicit, too. Can a story be told without it always leading to sex?

2019-05-30 16:45:38,I’ve tried several of these role play games and this one by far is my favorite!! You get five free diamonds every thirty min several times a day and you get free diamonds after each chapter and for some of your choices. Even when I choose an option without diamonds the story still stays in the good. These stories are grown up and I love that. I’m a 45 yr old that loves romance novels and these are just like reading one but the decisions are mine and the stories are not long and drawn out. Most that I’ve loved have a part two to them and I love that as well. Just overall a fun game even for adults like me. Keep up the good work!!!,5,False,Downloads Galore,Love this game,

I then saw “mr and mr Smith” and It made me happy but that’s only one story about two men and I’d love to see more. I hope you will make it more inclusive, maybe by adding the option to choose your gender and choose if you’re straight,gay,bi,trans ect.

There’s also other problems, I get why outfits need gems to unlock but to not be able to choose the direction of the story is really annoying. This is meant to be a game where you can choose what happens but there’s hardly any choices to be made. Another thing is the tickets, I hate waiting two hours to finish one chapter. It’s a literal cash grab, I thought when I woke up I was going to have at least 3 tickets and I wake up to two. I’ve never seen an app so stingy.

2018-09-28 16:29:57,This was easily the best story app in the App Store. It refreshes with new lives every thirty minutes(short compared to other story apps) and you could watch videos to earn diamonds. The diamonds allow you to make better choices in the story. With this new update they have now limited the amount of videos you can watch PER DAY to four. It makes the game significantly less enjoyable. Every choice costs upwards of 12 diamonds. So it takes three days to make enough diamonds to make a choice. That is unless you play another story to make enough diamonds for the story you're actually interested in.

Each good option costs 12-17 gems, but you only get 2-4 gems (depending on whether you watch an ad) per chapter. Otherwise you will need to spend real money to get more gems.

If you don’t have enough gems, you are stuck choosing the bad options in the story such as telling a kid in the hospital that he isn’t your favorite patient, rejecting a kid when she wants you to be her god parent with the male lead, wearing causal clothes to a ceremony, or rejecting the male lead outright when he tries to make an advance.

- Diverse range of MCs that you can choose from.
- I like how there are Rated R stories for 18+ readers. 
- The characters (Especially the love interests) in these stories are much more memorable ex. Daemon Black, Seth Wolf, Fenris.
- I LOVE that you can talk with other readers in the comments right below the story. It gives you a sense of community and you can discuss what happened in the book. This is something Choices greatly lacks.
- I prefer stories that have direction, and not so focused on different endings (Some people like this, but I don’t). I feel like stories that have complicated branching like Choices miss out on a ton of detail because the author focuses too much on how many paths there are.

Cons:
- Too much contemporary romance books and not enough sci-fi, paranormal, thriller, and mystery books.

The one con is the amount of gems needed to choose a decent response to certain selections only to learn it was a waste of time and gems as the premium choices do not improve the storyline at all, which is very frustrating!!

2019-09-21 17:29:17,Not sure if it’s the game or something else but when it starts to load it says at the bottom No Resource Update and won’t let me play. So I haven’t been able to play for a while but before when it was working I absolutely love the game. Please help I’d love to continue playing.,4,False,Kay+kay86,No Resource Update. Please help what does this mean.,
2020-02-03 11:56:17,Pretty bad that there is an app that I really enjoy and I have to pay to get what I want and then I can’t even watch ads because it keeps telling me there aren’t any ready! 😡😡😡 should not have to pay so many diamonds for things and shouldn’t have a limit on ads and then maybe they should be available when you want to watch them!,3,False,tmw22171,Upset 😡,"{'id': 13295426, 'body': 'Hello!

2020-01-16 09:26:18,This app will have you broke in no time flat you constantly have to buy gems and sometimes tickets the story’s are amazing but expensive! Unless you’re millionaire I don’t recommend downloading this app I just deleted until they fix this if you buy $100 worth of gems it’s only going to last you like 3 chapters before you have to buy again another $100 worth of gems please beware of this!,2,False,Iceyten,Beware!,"{'id': 13698262, 'body': 'Hello!

2019-11-03 06:45:02,I loved this app until I realized for just one chapter I had to spend $20 just to be able to pick the choices I wanted through the chapter. It’s ridiculous why does it have to cost 17 or 12 diamonds just to choose what I want? It would be so much better if it was 2-4 diamonds or just have to purchase tickets. It would’ve made me keep the app but ain’t no way in hell im going to play a game about “choices” when I can’t even choose what I want because I ran out of diamonds and my real money.,1,False,kcantu21,F THE DIAMONDS,
2019-09-13 03:15:06,"I wanna start by saying that I did and still do love this app!! However I’ve recently been getting notifications that my phone is out of storage, only to find out that it was taking up 45GB of my phones storage. I loved the stories but that was absolutely ridiculous.",4,False,Alibear64,Takes a lot of storage,
2019-09-08 17:12:51,"The app itself like the stories, I love. The app was just updated and has a different format or style. You have to be in 1 tab to see all the stories and another to play/read the ones you’re currently reading. It was better before where it was all in one spot.",4,False,megz217,Love the app but don’t like the new format,
2019-08-21 22:28:18,I love the app & its stories. There’s something intriguing every week BUT a lot of the good choices are worth diamonds and they don’t give you enough to last even in 1 chapter. That’s one thing I wish I could change. The diamond choices are to high but other than that I have no issues with it.,4,False,Just call me Ash,Great app but expensive,
2019-02-05 00:55:23,"I love love love this game! The only downside is the diamond choices are so expensive! The cheapest one I’ve seen is 12 diamonds and that was a while ago. It would be fine if there were less diamond choices in the chapters, anytime I need to make a important decision I can’t choose the one I want to keep the story going how I want it.",4,False,Boi1234567890123,Diamond choices,
2019-07-12 01:31:03,"This game is horrible unless you plan on spending money. The story’s are mildly interesting & there is no free choice in this game unless you pay. You can watch adds but the reward from that aren’t even worth it. If you plan on playing this game without spending money, don’t. Go buy a book, Download free ebooks, whatever anything is better than ‘playing’(I say that loosely because it’s not playing at all if you have no choice in actions) this game.",1,False,QDevyn,This might be alright if you pay a ton of money,
2019-07-01 07:07:45,"I love the app but I used to be able to watch ads for free diamonds. At first I could watch 5 every 24 hours, then last week I was able to watch 5 every half hour. Now I can’t watch any?!! I refuse to pay money for stupid gems. Especially at the outrageous price and the fact that they don’t last. So my question is, where are the ads? Why have they been taken away from us?",2,False,MLV121698,Where’s the Ads for free diamonds??,
2019-04-09 14:00:38,I have been reading Romeo and Juliet and I love it! However I chose to wear a mask during the fashion show and now it won’t come off. I’m now on chapter 8 and the mask is still on her face. I’m just hoping you guys can fix it! Thank you so much!,5,False,Nikkib9901,Amazing app!

2019-03-15 15:12:01,"I went through a whole book without using any diamonds, just to see if the gist was the same. It ends with her moving back home, being lonely and a loser! There is absolutely no way to have an ending even kind of okay without paying for it. Complete bull crap. I get not getting all the backstory or scenes but the ending? And the last decision wanted 27 diamonds!! Yeah no. The ending should still be satisfactory after all those tickets and time. I won’t be wasting my time on these apps anymore.",1,False,Ahaueter,Pay to play,
2018-10-28 05:26:02,Let me just say that this has started a brand new obsession and as a student this isn’t good for my sleep schedule 😂 but in all honesty this app is great I love the stories and the app itself I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good read!,5,False,what shpuld my nicknae be?,It’s a great experience,
2018-10-10 18:03:17,Love this app it’s got great stories and its graphics are great! The only thing I would like to see change is all the great choices not cost so much in diamonds! And have more to customize with the characters! But over all of it it’s a great fun game that is hard to put down!,5,False,KLS Angelofdeath,Love it,
2018-10-05 06:43:36,I love this app! I hope they come with a better way to get more tickets and diamonds in the future though. Or maybe a monthly subscription? I like that there isn’t all the ads. I would and have spent money on it. This is the best story app I have found!,5,False,Mel53182,Best story app!,
