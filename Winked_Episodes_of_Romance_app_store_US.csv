2022-05-06 23:04:53,"I wanted to leave a review to show support and hopefully encourage others to give it a try. I’ve played through a lot of dating simulators and Winked is by far the best. It’s well written and even though the answers are pre-written, you still feel like an actual participant when communicating/engaging with your matches. The available matches are diverse and have great back stories. It isn’t just about hooking up, boring conversation, and unnecessary drama for the sake of keeping things “interesting”. It is obvious the developers care about this app and us as the player because the conversations and dates are stimulating, fun, and inclusive. If you do decide to spend your diamonds (or don’t because you can get extended scenes, rewards, etc. without paying), the content/conversation is worth it. On that same note, even if you don’t pay to load up on extra diamonds or choose not to spend diamonds on outfits, content, pictures, etc.), your relationships still progress. I’m big into RPG’s and Simulators and as far as a mobile simulator, Winked is pretty much unmatched. Also, the developers are very friendly, quick to respond, and always helpful. Seeing the app progress is exciting and I can’t wait to see it unfold. Thanks Nanobit!",5,False,Scoobs8806,Best Dating Simulator!!! Love it.,
2024-01-19 05:46:16,"The app is kinda glitchy. Not super, and there is no ads so I can’t complain there. But I think after a week of using it, I can give a fair review. 1.) if you don’t know, some of the characters have the same stories as each other. Such as Kaitlyn and Aniyah. However, when matching with Aniyah and heading on a date with her, I find that Kaitlyn’s character is there with her name rather than Aniyah’s character and name. Which, it’s not a big deal and doesn’t make a big difference story wise (obviously because it’s the same story) it just throws you completely out of the moment. If it were just that glitch I experienced, I wouldn’t be make a review. However… 2.) the only reason this rating is as low as it is. I made an in-app purchase. I know, I have no shame (and I don’t care 😝) I have actually made several purchases. And the only one that hasn’t worked was my most recent. I made a purchase of $10 (roughly) and the money charged my account. HOWEVER, I don’t have my heart gem whatever thing-a-ma-bobs. And like, it’s only 10 bucks. But I expect an app that is charging me to allow me to view content, to actually give me the items I buy. That is the only reason why I can’t give this app a full 5 stars. If someone else experiences this, or multiple people do, it’s frustrating. And I sincerely hope that the developers care enough to fix this issue.

2023-04-19 18:27:00,"**update** after writing this review they gifted me the amount of diamonds I had lost during the glitch. Reviewed stars updated from 1 to 3. This would be a 5 if the game didn’t unmatch if I spend some time not playing - causing me to lose all progress and diamonds spent for those matches. Is truly the only off putting aspect of the game where no other apps like this have this feature. 

Original review: I purchased 3600 diamonds and used during the Cupid rewards game thing they have going on. Claim button, to “cash out” and stop playing wouldn’t work so I kept spending gems when I got the card that can cause you to lose. No big deal. I get to the point where I’ve paid in nearly all these diamonds and click claim, a few times again, to cash out and nothing continued to happen until the game closes/crashes. Customer support says to me, after reopen the crashed game and find neither my diamonds nor the rewards are there, that there is nothing wrong on their end but here’s 150 diamonds as a convenience. All I wanted was the rewards, I’m fine with spending the money, took a screen shot to send and everything when the claim button through 40 something rounds wasn’t working.

2023-08-22 03:14:38,"I was very excited when the “Perfect Match” mini game was first introduced. I thought it was a great way for players to get gems without having to purchase them. Being able to get ten gems for every round you won, and therefore up to 100 gems a day if you won every round, was a game changer, it made me actually want to play the game again considering I could actually afford to. Now it’s only five gems a round and only fifty seconds to complete the matching game, versus the previous sixty. Now the game is too difficult for what it’s worth. If they had dropped the time but kept the prizes the same I would’ve been fine with it, but the dropped how much you can win as well. This just tells me they got scared of people using the game for diamond mining and decided to put their selfishness on full display by dropping the reward. I’ve thought that the developers for this game were selfish for a while, but that “Perfect Match” was a step in the right direction, but I was wrong. There is nothing about this app that makes spending actual money on it worth it, and how the developers act makes it even less likely that I’ll give them my real money again, and I regret spending any money I already have.

So I’ve been playing for over a week. Um the storyline are pretty versatile. I don’t love that you literally can have a “perfect” date without using gems in on way or another. Also I was playing the event and used my gems on that and it glitched and then I had to do they date over so I didn’t get all the rewards I would have gotten. Also I was just playing the “game of love “ and it glitched and took extra gem when I went used them to keep going so all in all I’m out like 800 gems which I earned!!! So annoying, definitely would pay for gems know that a glitch can get them wasted so easily but I do really like the story lines.

I’m going to start by saying, I wish I had read the reviews before I downloaded or even purchased my first diamonds. With that said, the game is fun. It’s intriguing, the storylines pull you in. It’s entertaining at best. However, there is one main thing that needs work. That is the cost of the gems/diamonds and how many gems it costs per challenge/date/clothes/hair/response etc. It is honestly outrageous. Like someone said you’re literally paying $1 per 100 gems.

I’m sitting on four storylines that haven’t been touched in *months*, one of which (Edward) has to be near completion. What’s the ultimate goal for these chats?

This is what I have an issue with. 

In order to actually choose options that progress your relationship, view pictures/photos/videos and hear voice messages it takes over 200 gems. 200. Per item. Per choice. 

You get 45 gems a day for free. That’s it. 

You get 10/20 gems for going on a date/leveling up. That’s it. 

When I first started playing I had an option to watch videos for a few extra free gems a day. Was it a lot?  No. Was it helpful? Eh.  But!! That option when away as soon as I made a purchase in game. 🤨 so I emailed and was told that it was based on my location/time of day. So I downloaded the game on another phone- same kind of phone. Same location.  Same day/time.

It started out fun - I could unmatch the nasty ones and keep the pg-13 dates if I wanted - but the game crashed multiple times a minute. A MINUTE.

Diamonds are necessary to continue to story (or complete parts of it, or interact the way you want), and sometimes because of glitches they aren’t awarded properly when you earn them by leveling up in relationship. 

Purchases are always successful tho. Of course.

Tried to get customer service for diamonds I earned but wasn’t awarded after another crash. I was told by Nanobit to give them a detailed description of my problem in English. The original message was in English - in detail. Um…what?

They followed up saying they hadn’t heard from me so they closed the case as resolved - no diamonds for me. But they successfully scammed $50+ from me.

I love the option to watch ads a day for free gems (but once you make a purchase the ads are gone- so watch out). And they hardly update the female matches. Other updates are slow, as well. But I do like how you can customize your own character (although even if you buy outfits, you can’t wear them on other dates; that should be changed as well, because it makes users not wanna buy date outfits, as much.) & it would also be cool to customize our dates. Lastly, they barely give you any time before the characters unmatch you. IMO, that’s stupid because not everyone has time to play daily or even access, especially with no wifi signal, like if you’re out on a cruise/boat. Normally it’s supposed to be 24 hours, but I’ve experienced a glitch where I was unmatched just hours after texting back and I had to reach out to customer service to fix it. Granted, CS is pretty on point & will usually reimburse for issues, but they take a while to reply and you have to end up spending 250 gems just to get progress back, or choose to start all over. Without those negative qualities of the app, it could easily be 5 stars. Please, creators, we need these things fixed! I’ve heard so many complaints about it and some people are switching over to other apps because of it. STOP the automatic unmatching feature! Give people time to play. We have lives.

I also have just had to say a comment in the conversation about a hobby that i would never say so i wish there again that there were more options for how the conversation could go.   Also, if this really is simulating a dating app, then more options need to be programmed in for the matches available.  For example, i would be looking for a man in real life.  I have no interest in women.  I've declined about 5 women in the 12 hours i've been playing.  If the number of matches is limited anyway, then it would make more sense to at least have that filter in there for who you want to interact with.  My first date also had the wrong avatar the whole time.  It was supposed to be Matt, and in the conversation it was Matt but the man himself was labeled as Noah and the picture was nothing like Matt.  It was correct on the second date.

2022-06-30 23:06:00,"I really enjoy Winked, especially the depth the devs put in to the stories, dates and images.  Each story and character has a unique feel, though maybe not super unique sprites.  In the short time I’ve been playing, I’ve already seen the update of more customizable sprites, the addition of the daily game, character updates plus new characters added, more images and voice files, plus the fun unavailable matches they throw in that have turned in to new characters down the road.  Sure, the gem choices can be a bit pricey, but the daily game gives so many prizes and gems that it’s really become quite easy to get the higher priced features.  

My only big complaint at this time is the auto match feature.  I don’t want to be auto matched with the new characters, I want the choice to match with the character I choose.  And with no way to switch between counterparts (a feature that Winked is missing compared to an alternative game of similar nature), there are now characters I have zero desires to chat with.  Just today, I missed out on being able to match with Massimo, a character I have been waiting anxiously for since his profile was first introduced as unavailable, and was automatically matched with his counterpart, Daniel.  As such, poor Daniel will be completely ignored by my MC all because he’s not the one character I’ve been wanting for so long.  Until this feature of auto matching changes, I can’t give the game a higher review.  It really kills the fun and excitement of new matches.",3,False,Willenbringb,Auto Match is ruining the fun of new matches,

I know some ppl get into character w/ games like this but, some don’t & I don’t. Yall should take polls & ask us how we’d respond in certain scenarios. That way yall could have better options for us to choose from & yall can know how to make the date respond. Sometimes I want to be mad, be petty b/c they’ve done or said the most absurd stuff. But, it’ll be a “no, I understand why you treated me like a dog. No we’re cool.” Like whaaa?! Or they have times where they’ll have us just be completely rude b/c we didn’t spend a billion gems to pick the nice response. Also….the game is very much so rated sexual in content. Yall have scenarios where there’s dates just abt being just for that. Which if I ever pick, I immediately un-match. & the other ones are supposed to be normal. Of course I expect it to get there. B/c it gets there irl lol! But, even those aren’t normal. If we don’t choose to go get it in, in the middle of a met gala then we’ve disappointed our date & the lever never moves. Thats not weird?! So, then this entire game is just based off that one thing then right?!  Like the creator has some kind of secret fetish to doing things in public & getting caught. B/c I haven’t matched w/ one yet that hasn’t tried that same scenario! & here’s my thing…they’re always the ones to bring it up…but, you want me to pay 250 gems for it. & if I don’t……..there’s not much progress. Like?!

The best part of the game is the mini games. But, they glitch! This is just a buy gems & lose em kind of a game.

2023-08-25 22:54:10,"I really love this game, and there has been many updates since the last time I reviewed in which I’d like to add on. I like that the amount of gems you earn when each level with matches goes up increased. I also love the addition of the “game of love” and I like the potential it serves—However, chances of getting anything that’s of high quality in the game is really low. I’m more likely than not to choose the “heartbreaker” card on my second chance: this being said I feel like beings we have to pay to be able to ‘continue’ playing that our chances of earning higher quality items should increase as well. May it be increasing the amount of higher quality options within the cards, or increasing the amount of cards in general. This way instead of there being a 1/4 chance of getting a heartbreaker card it’d be a 1/6, then a 1/8–idk it only seems fair that the chances of getting higher quality cards would increase when the amount of gems to continue increases each time, and we may end up with nothing at all. I also think that if we lose we should be able to collect everything we’d gotten, because even if we didn’t press the finish button we still had to spend our gems to get more chances to continue. I also wanted to point out how pricey “premium” choices are. From the initial ‘dressing up’ for the dates to the actual choices, it’s 500 gems a date, yet we only get 45-55 free gems a day. (The rewards gems aren’t ever granted either) If we have multiple matches we’re focused on and don’t want to miss out on what the premium choices unlock, it can take DAYS—literally just to earn half of that with the free gems we get daily, and what little we get from the love game. To add on the dates and matches—beings choices are pretty pricey I often exit dates and wait for days in order to build the amount of gems I have to pick the premium choices. With this the notifications about my matches unmatching me come pretty quickly, and when it happens you have to pay a lot to resume the story with them. I love how interactive this game is. I like how we’re able to customize characters, though we’re not able to choose a gender, and options for POC is lacking, I like that’s it’s offered. I also like how a previous suggestion from my former review was added when it comes to not having to pay for outfits we’ve already bought with other dates and matches. The stories are great and I just adore the characters and their stories. Each one is unique and there’re often things that happen in them that I don’t quite expect. This is definitely one of my favorite interactive games, and love how you guys take your time updating and improving the game.

Most recent update: I really love this game, but it’s just too expensive. Wait times are crazy, and honestly the amount of gems that’s offered to pay for isn’t enough. Very disappointing that I’ve been on and off of this game and after about of year of not playing, there still aren’t very many offered ways of getting more gems accessibly.

2023-04-01 10:28:41,"I do agree with everyone else that is saying this game is way to expensive.
you start off with 1000 hearts I believe right?.
Let's say you go on a date with one of you're matches and you decide to buy a cute outfit to impress you're date which is about 200 or more then you decide to buy a hairstyle which is about 60 or more.
While on the date you'll get to say stuff that makes you're match happier and makes the date better for you as well, but you have to spend some hearts in order to even say those things which are also very expensive like 200 or more.
Then after all that, you'll have the choice to continue the date or go home and to continue it cost about 500!!! Yayyyyy.
Which I doubt anyone would have enough hearts left after buying all those other things to make the date go perfectly well :).

There is no option to watch ads to get more hearts nor can we do surveys.

And I'm probably sure there is not one thing on this game that you can buy for 30 hearts.

and then we have to wait 23 hours which you guys can just say 24 hours, for 40 hearts that won't help us either.

I'm confused why do we have to wait almost a day just for 40 hearts when almost everything on the game cost more then 100 hearts???.

I'd rather wait a day for 200 hearts because that's more reasonable.

also a whole day we have to wait just for 40 hearts? Can you guys at least lower it down to 8 hours or even better just one hour.

This game definitely is money seeking and wants people to spend all their money.

2023-12-09 09:50:51,"First, I think the pics, audio, video, clothes, hair and comment choices should not cost as much as they do. You don’t allow us to earn enough in a 48 hour period to have these items cost as many diamonds as they do.  I get you need to make money, but your ratios are too expensive.  

Second, as others have commented, I should not have to waste swipes on same sex matches when my character is not lesbian or bi.  Please make this more customizable based on the player. 

Third, I agree with the commenter about more realistic conversation options. For instance, I won’t give away the match identity, but when my guy tells me he wants to spend most of his downtime with me and then proceeds to go out to bars 3 nights in a row…with no invitation for me to join him…my options shouldn’t be to tell him I’m just going to curl up with a book at home!  No my option should be to ask if I’m invited, or maybe to ask if he really meant it about spending time with me or is he just stringing me along.  This is my first time through this app, so perhaps this match is simply doomed to failure.  But after spending at least 3000 diamonds on this guy it’s more than a little disappointing.  It’s just a game, but when I’m spending some money on it I’d like a few more options to make it more realistic.

Otherwise, I enjoy the storylines, the art and the game overall.  It’d be great if there was a subscribe option with a monthly fee for diamonds or other ways to earn more diamonds each day.

So fun and unrealistic(which is great).I have a few suggestions though..I know the developers put a lot of effort so you can't complain about the paid experiences..I just wish that the diamond points racked up a bit more..only 10 at a time in convos is a bit small. Well when you get them through achievements..it's kinda decent amounts at least. I also wish I was able to match with everyone..sometimes they don't like me back?! This is a game..it hasn't been realistic..but not everyone likes you? Irony lol.I wish your job could be chosen (in each convo)..I think only one convo let me choose between just two jobs. Since in every match you can have a different occupation. Also during convos ..you kinda don't have many choices sometimes..the two choices end up being the same actually.Lastly, the match game only gives you 5 points..and it's quite difficult and laggy to play.All this to say..the game is great, but I wish certain things were different.

I normally don’t have enough diamonds to look at the picture or listen to the audio.

Now I go on the Free Coin page and that game isn’t even listed anymore. WHEW, all of that was reason 1 for the review. 

Reason TWO… it’s impossible to win the match game without a way to earn (EARN, not pay for) extra time in the clock. How about for every correct match, you get an extra sec added to your time?

2022-12-04 17:18:41,"Here is my honest review, The concept and stories are great….. BUT, to play the game at its Prime story - ITS GONNA COST YOU… You don’t get enough Diamonds a day, to help you .  Prime Dates - COST, even sometimes answering a question , the way you want to - COST . Picking the best outfit - COST.  Extending a date - COST … to listen to a message - COST .. And, GOD HELP YOU, if you engage with multiply messages/potential mates …. You need to save your diamonds for real dates. 

you may get abt 45 diamonds a day - but a date will cost you 250, A outfit will cost anywhere from 180 - 250, listening to a message cost abt 300, answering a question in your conversation cost 120 …..and, this is every conversation…. Just be mindful 
There is no way to earn more DIamonds.

But, like I said- Great game, that actually enjoy playing…. But, for the sake of my wallet - I had to disable this games access to my debit card…..

I have it and it’s a pretty cool game But, I added up what I was spending on this game, it was ridiculous…. Especially for app on my phone 👀👀👀

However, all of the best choices need gems to unlock them. Which is understandable. That’s how the app makes money, and I don’t mind spending a little money on an app that I love as much as this one. But gems are insanely expensive. For $5 you 500 gems. That’s basically only two “premium” choices. $100 (!!!???) would get you 15000 gems which would be 75 of those premium choices, and that’s if you don’t want to unlock pictures, videos, and aspirations to further a relationship. You also have the option to purchase outfits which boost relationship progress. I think I purchased 2 before I realized that you don’t get to “keep” these outfits.

The matches are a great idea, the variety of options for them is amazing, the storyline is impeccable, and if the gems were a little cheaper the premium choices would be very worth it.

The diversity in characters, details of the potential matches, graphics, storylines and even pre-written responses are all well thought out. It’s evident the developers have done their research and care about this product to have it in some ways model the feel of an actual dating app. However, the cost adds up to enjoy the game they way you want to and quickly. It feels as though once you make more than one purchase the system recognizes that you’re willing to spend money and the longer you’re in connection with matches the more you’re presented with options to spend more diamonds. For my storylines that have progressed the farthest, diamond responses pop up several times within a short stint of the conversation. Through a conversation I should not have to pay 120-250 diamonds just for one response several times. Especially if you are matched with multiple people and also want to enjoy features like a better outfit for a date or added experiences than can lead to bonus content. If you purchase diamonds you can spend $20 just for 2600 and they get used up so quickly just by either choosing a nicer outfit, extending a date or a simple response within a conversation. I understand this is a business and the developers need to generate revenue but imagine how quickly $20 can turn into $100 and so on. I would appreciate the game better if there were a third text response option that was maybe less expensive. Similar to how outfits worth 250 diamonds are premium and the lesser ones cost less. Return on investment is key. If you invest your money you want to know what you’re getting in return is worth it. And with some relationships moving at a slower pace than others you don’t want to feel like your money for diamonds is wasted. Options allows the user to feel like we can choose how engaged we want to be. But most of the time if you do not select a Diamond response, you’ve missed out on an experience or gaining an aspiration to add to your collection. Also the photo/video/audio messages are extremely high priced. Especially when the audio message is nothing more than an extended text. There are no voices. Half the time you can skip paying for them and continue the conversation giving the impression you’ve viewed an image or video just to hold on to your diamonds. While it may mean you miss out on collecting bonus diamonds for meeting milestones within the game but you have to weigh your options and use your diamonds strategically. Even if you visit the game daily and play the Game of Love to earn more, what you’re earning is still not enough to prevent you from having to invest a significant amount of money to enjoy the game to the fullest.

Especially the “spend 2,500 gems” achievement and it only gives you 150 as the reward??? Where is the sense in that. The rewards are mostly 25-50 gems but the game options are 100-350 gems…. I feel like your ripping me off, not even the option to buy gems look reasonable because you give so little.",2,False,Keahhi,The gems????,"{'id': 29332035, 'body': 'Hi there, we’re sorry to hear that the game is not to your liking.
